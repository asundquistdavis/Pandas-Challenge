# Pandas Challenge
This repository is for the Pandas challenge problem and to explore.

### Scope
The pandas challenge uses python pandas module to analyse student data from a school district to determine if any trends exist at the school level. 

### Contents
The repo contains a jupyter notebook folder that contains one file with all of the data processing and analysis. 

There is also a folder which includes the resources, provided by Trilogy Education Services.

The .gitingore is configured to python.

### Methods
The main tool used to perform analysis is python's Pandas module. All the data is loaded from CSV as datframes, checked for incomplete or missing data and joined into a single df. 

From here, the dataframe is manipulated using filtering, groupbys and sorting to produce sub dataframes. Cleaning up the data in these dfs gives summary tables of the data.
