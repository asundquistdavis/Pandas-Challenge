    "### Analysis\n",
    "The above report looked at student data across 15 schools from one school district. The report summarizes students' scores and passing rates by schools. In addition to showing the top and bottom performing schools, the report observes two main trends in the scores by school spending and scores by school size tables. When looking as schools spending per student in different ranges, all five **scores recorded decreased when increasing in spending range**. This could imply that spending more money per student negatively impacts students' scores and passing rates. Similarly, looking at schools in different size ranges, the **scores generally decrease as size of school increases**. This could be interpreted as larger schools negatively impact students' scores. In both of these cases, further hypothesis testing, such as a chi-squared test, should be used to determine if the trend is significant or just a coincidence. Another caveat is that school spending per student and school size could be related. With the data given and current analysis, it is not possible to tell if one is being caused by the other or if both are truly causing student's scores to be higher; only a relation is known, not a causation."
